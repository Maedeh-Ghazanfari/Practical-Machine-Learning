# Hard Margin vs. Soft Margin in SVM

Support Vector Machines (SVM) aim to find the best hyperplane that separates data into classes. Depending on the nature of the dataset, we choose between a **Hard Margin** or a **Soft Margin** approach.

## Hard Margin SVM

### Definition
Hard Margin SVM tries to perfectly separate the data with a maximum-margin hyperplane and **no tolerance for errors**.

### Constraint
