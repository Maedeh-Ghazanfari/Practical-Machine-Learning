# Hard Margin vs. Soft Margin in SVM

Support Vector Machines (SVM) aim to find the best hyperplane that separates data into classes. Depending on the nature of the dataset, we choose between a **Hard Margin** or a **Soft Margin** approach.

---

## Hard Margin SVM

### Definition
Hard Margin SVM tries to perfectly separate the data with a maximum-margin hyperplane and **no tolerance for errors**.

### Constraint
yᵢ (wᵗxᵢ + b) ≥ 1 for all i

### When to Use
- The dataset is **linearly separable**
- There is **no noise** or outliers

### Drawbacks
- **Sensitive to outliers**
- Rarely useful in real-world, messy datasets

## Soft Margin SVM

### Definition
Soft Margin SVM allows **some misclassifications** to achieve better generalization. It balances between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors.

### Modified Constraint

yᵢ (wᵗxᵢ + b) ≥ 1 - ξᵢ where ξᵢ ≥ 0 (slack variables)


### Objective Function

Minimize: ½ ||w||² + C ∑ ξᵢ


- `||w||²`: Controls margin width
- `∑ ξᵢ`: Penalizes misclassified or margin-violating points
- `C`: Regularization parameter controlling trade-off

### When to Use
- Data is **not perfectly separable**
- Real-world datasets with **noise** or **overlap**

## Comparison Table

| Feature                  | Hard Margin SVM         | Soft Margin SVM            |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Misclassification        | ❌ Not allowed           | ✅ Allowed (penalized)      |
| Suitable for             | Clean, separable data   | Noisy, overlapping data     |
| Robust to outliers       | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes                      |
| Used in practice         | ❌ Rare                  | ✅ Common                   |

## Key Takeaway

Use **Hard Margin** only when you're absolutely sure your data is clean and separable. In almost all practical scenarios, **Soft Margin SVM** is the go-to choice due to its flexibility and tolerance for real-world imperfections.
